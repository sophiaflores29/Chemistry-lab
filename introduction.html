<H1>Introduction and hypothesis
<H1><b>PH Scale </b></H1>

<H1><b>Introduction</b></H1>
<font size="3">In this experiment, we explored the pH levels of various everyday products to determine<br><br>

whether they are acidic, neutral, or basic. The pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, helps <br><br>

above 7 indicate basicity. For our investigation, we tested a variety of common items including yogurt,<br><br> 

Lipton tea, milk, orange juice, alcohol, lemon, chloride, bicarbonate, pineapple juice, Ronald pie,<br> <br>

and Nelson pie.By measuring their pH levels, we aimed to identify where each product falls on the pH scale and better<br><br> 

understand their chemical properties. This experiment not only enhances our knowledge of pH in real-world<br><br> 

contexts, but also reinforces how chemistry applies to the products we use and consume every day.<br><br>

<P>
<H1><b>Hypothesis</b></H1>

<font size="3"> If we test the pH levels of everyday products,<br><br>

then acidic items like lemon and orange juice will have pH values below 7,<br><br>
 
neutral items like milk will have a pH around 7, and basic items like bicarbonate will<br><br>

have pH values above 7, because their chemical composition determines their<br><br>

placement on the pH scale.<br><br>
