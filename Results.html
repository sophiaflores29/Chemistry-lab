This experiment helped us better understand the chemical properties of everyday products <br><br>
and how we can use natural materials to study science in a fun and simple way.<br><br>

<H1><b>Conclusions</b></H1>
<font size="3">
In this experiment, we discovered that red cabbage juice can be used as a natural pH indicator to test whether<br><br>
a substance is acidic, neutral, or basic. By adding different household substances to the cabbage juice,<br><br> 
we observed color changes that helped us identify their pH levels. Substances like lemon juice and vinegar<br><br>
 turned the juice red or pink, showing they are acidic. Soap and baking soda turned it green or blue,<br><br> 
showing they are basic. Some substances, like water or milk, kept the juice purple, meaning they are neutral.<br><br>
