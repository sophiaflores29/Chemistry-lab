<TD> Stratford Shakespearean Festival, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, 1956

Minor chords ring across Stratford farmland. We jazz<Br>
wherever we’re called. Local ears lift to see jazz.<Br>

Their hearts hear in places their minds roam.<Br>
Oh, if the bard could be Black! She’d be jazz.<Br>

If the hogs across the way, just for a moment, were swans<Br>
released in a lake, they’d think, this is the sea: jazz!<Br>

Tell me, if Cleo walked in here right now,<Br>
would her stride, royal to her jeweled toes, be jazz?<Br>

Britt Woodman’s Hank Cinq and all them<Br>
octave jumps! Slide your trombone, man! Free Jazz!<Br>

Now, wipe the sleep from your eyes. The time has come:<Br>
Your ideas must speak the language that be jazz.<Br>

Who said no Blacks allowed in orchestra seats?<Br>
Leave the balcony empty tonight; let that be jazz.<Br>

Emmett Till’s body found floating in the Tallahatchie River.<Br>
Emmett Till’s name still rises, and, believe me, that be jazz.<Br>

Schools in Topeka, Kansas, threw open their doors.<Br>
Integration? Call it what you want, but, shit, man—that be jazz.<Br>

Tamora’s baby came out Black, you say? Damn. The more<Br>
I hear of Aaron the Moor, the more I think: don’t that be jazz?<Br>

A note above ~ A note below ~ The note between ~<Br>
The tonic ~ Enclosed ~ Pivoted up ~ Octave ~ That be jazz.<Br>

Oh, if the bard could be Black! Her stride would be royal, jeweled toes ... <Br>
your ideas must speak. Aaron and more. Till’s name still rises! That be jazz.<Br>

The circle of fourths comes full circle now. You bards,<Br>
Duke, Billy, the children are dancing! Enough: Let that be jazz.<Br>
